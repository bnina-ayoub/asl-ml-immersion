I\\u2019m not allowed to call him when I\\u2019m suicidal anymore, and he wants me to tell some other people about my issues, and if I\\u2019m not getting professional help by the end of the month then we can\\u2019t be friends anymore. \\nI understand the reasons behind all of them and it\\u2019s good that he\\u2019s protecting himself but it hurts so much. I actually let myself believe that he wasn\\u2019t gonna leave me, I let myself believe that he was different. I still love him so much but now I cry every time I think about him. \\nI don\\u2019t know how to deal with this. I know I need to put my walls back up but I can\\u2019t lie to him. \\nHi Jamie42,\\nWellcome to our forums!\\nIm so sorry to hear that your friend has said that to you, it would hurt.\\nPlease know we are all a lovely caring community and you can chat to us anytime about anything.\\nCan I ask if you have been able to speak to a health professional about the way you are feeling?\\nHello Jamie, and welcome to the site.\\nI'm sorry to hear that this has been said, but perhaps it may be their way of wanting you to get professional help and that they are stuck with the help they have offered and don't necessarily know what else to suggest.\\nSometimes when this does happen maybe because they don't have any answers that will help you and then in return become affected themselves in a negative way, although I'm not a doctor to say, but know from my experience is why my friends disappeared, it became too much for them to handle.\\nThe love you have for him can still remain, but sometimes we expect this person to be with us all the way, but they have their own responsibility, in not only trying to get on with their own life but trying to cope in how you are feeling and that's an enormous burden to try and sort out, that could be a reason why he has said what he did.\\nIf at any time you are feeling that you want to do something then please dial 000, they will take you to the hospital for your own self keeping, that's one option, another one is, that we know we can lean on friends but a counsellor is better equipped with experience and knowledge to be able to talk through the issues you are struggling with.\\nDid you know about the 'mental health plan' your doctor can offer you, it gives you 10 Medicare paid sessions per year so you can talk with a psych.\\nWe hope to talk with you again.\\nGeoff.\\nHi Jamie42,\\nI\\u2019m so sorry that you don\\u2019t feel like you have the same support from your friend. Although from his perspective, that must be an incredibly heavy burden to be tasked with the feeling of keeping your friend alive. In reality he\\u2019s probably just feeling a bit out of his depth, he hasn\\u2019t trained for this and doesn\\u2019t know what to do. So I do think it\\u2019s the best thing that you are under the care of a psychologist for this type of stuff. The reason that your friend is setting these boundaries is because he clearly loves and cares about you and so these things are distressing for him too. He isn\\u2019t leaving you, he is just making sure that the proper people are in charge of your health issues and he obviously was concerned that you wouldn\\u2019t seek out help unless pushed. When things settle down a bit I hope that you\\u2019ll see that he\\u2019s actually looking out for your best interests/care, even if it may not feel that way at the moment\",\n          \"Why me?-Hello Jo,\\nThanks for sharing your story, you certainly have been through a lot of stuff.\\nI certainly do wish you luck and blessing as you go on to what comes next, hopefully (hope fully) it will be a happy and safe place for you and your children, a place where you can be healed, restored, and then encouraged to move beyond where you have been to become a strong and wonderful person.  I pray that you will find the sort of friends you talk about, the sort who are always with you and barracking for you.\\nBless.\\n \\nhi jo, ditto everything suzbj said, you are freaking awesome and should be so incredibly proud of yourself for how you have not just coped with the **** hand you were dealt but blossomed! heck, to aspire to a uni degree when soooo many would just have given up being homeless and educationally disadvantaged in their teens. and, on top of that, you have righted the wrongs of the past generations, your parents left you for dead but you did EVERYTHING you could for your children, but did the most important in LOVING them.\\nyou, dear lady, are an inspiration, and i hope you get the fulfilling career you desire (don't worry about the man, you are so above that, and if there's meant to be one, he will find this amazing, caring, confident nurse in the future, and will give her the family she yearns for). confidence will greatly assist in finding valued and valuable people, so respect yourself, you bloody-well deserve too!\\nmany hugs, b\\nHi Jo\\nWhat an incredibly difficult journey you\\u2019ve been on and have had to endure.  Words that have already been expressed have been inspirational and awesome.  I fully agree with those and would like to add words like courageous and just downright amazing.\\nI couldn\\u2019t imagine the struggles that you\\u2019ve had to face and not only on your own,  but bringing up two children at the same time and on top of that, reaching out to further develop yourself with a Uni degree.\\nI really hope that by you coming onto this site and putting your story out there, that it has helped you in some tiny way \\u2026 just to get things off your chest.  I think by you telling your story it will serve as inspiration to many others on here and especially the line that you used:\\n\\u201c\\u2026 and I'm not going to let this beat me, but I am broken.\\u201d\\nJo, the inner strength that I feel from you that generates from those words in incredible.\\nAnd yes, I am wishing to you (and your children) for a brighter future, one that you can look forward too and one that you will be able to share with your children and watch them grow.  That\\u2019s possibly some time off yet, but for the time being, I just wish for you that you can make little advancements each day;  to try and create little goals (however small they may be) and to try and achieve them.\\nI do also hope that you will visit us from time to time to not only let us know how you\\u2019re getting on, but for you to actually participate on the forums here because I believe that you have incredible experience to share with others and from what you post, I believe that you will be able to help inspire others.\\nCheers\\nNeil\\nThank you everyone for your inspirational words.. They mean a lot.\\nYou are right Neil, I wanted my story to be out there as there are so many people down and out that needed there spirits lifted. I have numerous ways of coping with issues that life has thrown my way. I found the best way is to be open and honest not just to others but to myself. \\nI woke up this morning at 5am (been finding it hard to get out before lunch) the first thought that come to mind was, I forgot who I was, but now I remember who I am and who I want to be. It was strange it was like my subcontious said wake up to yourself Jo you need to pull it together and be the person you raised yourself to be. You are a great role model and love to help, so get up have a shower and do something useful.\\nEveryday I feel just that little bit stronger, I still find it hard to talk to my friends and I feel this is more from embarrassment than anything. But yesterday I had a breakthrough and went back to work. This was hard, I haven't left the house for over a week as the anxiety raised it's ugly head. I walked into work with my head down and really afraid that someone would say, gee you've lost a lot of weight. Instead a coworker walked past and I said wow you have lost a lot of weight. Well after 27 years she walked out from her marriage. This than bought the tears flowing from both of us. My heart broke for her. Then I realised that it's not just me that's struggling there are so many others out there. as she left she said thanks.. I didn't do anything only listen and if that's all it takes to help someone I will always be here.. \\nI don't want to struggle any more, I know I deserve better and I know that I don't have to settle for less than I desire. I will keep growing stronger everyday.\\nthankyou again for your kind words I will cherish them always.\\njodie\\nHi Jodie\\nInspirational again.  Please please keep on posting here because what you write is a really powerful message.\\nFrom your latest post I've picked up some positive vibes for myself.   \\\"Get up and do something useful\\\";   \\\"I will keep growing stronger everyday\\\".\\nThat's telling it to the mongrel dog ... keep him right in the back of his kennel;  listening to those words should have him cowering in the back of his kennel for a while.\\nI'm so pleased that you were able to get to work and then have such a meaningful and even emotional encounter with a colleague.  That's brilliant.\\nStay with us Jodie and beautiful post once again,\\nNeil\",\n          \"Stuck in the past-hi Angel, please can I welcome you to the site.\\nIt has taken great courage to post your comment, an enormous amount of strength for you to do this and I offer my deepest thoughts and condolences to you.\\nThis is something that you could talk about with to a dear friend or perhaps your doctor, so is there anyone you can do this with, certainly a doctor will understand and provide help and a friend will know how you are feeling, and we will also know the pain you are going through.\\nIt's good to keep yourself busy but you shouldn't keep this feeling all too yourself.\\nThere are many lovely people on this site who can listen to you and know exactly how you are feeling.\\nI am so deeply sorry. Geoff.\\nThank you for the welcome.\\nI have a few close close friends who know my pain but dont want to burden them. I have hid my depression very well, my husband hasnt even noticed, i dont want to stress him out either. He watched me die when we lost our son (obviously they got me back), i cant put him through anymore grief. \\nHello Angel2012\\nYou are strong by posting on the forums and thankyou for being with us\\nMy sincere condolences for the loss of your baby boy. I cant even fathom what you have been going through so I dont understand your pain except that you are in a dark place at the moment\\nI do understand depression after having it for a while now (under management of my GP)\\nIts sad that you have been hiding your depression. I did the same earlier on too. \\nDepression is no different to a broken limb....heart disease or diabetes. Its a condition that is partially chemically based which also makes it a physical illness\\nMaking a \\n appointment with your GP will bring you some peace back into your life Angel. Hiding our depression from a loved one will only exacerbate this common illness. You have everything to gain and nothing to lose by having a talk/vent with your GP/counselor.\\nMay I ask if you have been diagnosed with depression?\\nThe Good News.....Depressive symptoms do decrease in severity with regular ongoing counseling \\nYou are more than welcome to post as many times as you wish. I really hope you can post back when its convenient for you \\nYou are not alone \\nMy kindest thoughts for you Angel\\nPaul\\n \\nHi Angel 2012 \\nSo sad to hear about your heartache.
